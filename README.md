Dots and settings
==========

Hint: get `stow` installed first
Suggested location for the stow directory is `/usr/local/dots` so `root` would be always accessible

`home/` - dots for home dir, targets stow to `~`
`root/` - settings affecting whole the system, targets stow to `/`

Howto
-----

`cd home`
`ls` #
`stow bash` # will install bas settings to your `~`
